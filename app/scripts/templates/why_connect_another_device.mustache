  <p>
    {{#t}}Sync lets you securely find your bookmarks, passwords and more from any of your devices running Firefox.{{/t}}
  </p>
  <p>
    {{#t}}Sync isn't designed as a permanent backup â€“ it's just sharing what is saved locally. If you reset your password and your data isn't stored on at least one other device, you could lose all the information associated with the old password. That's why you'll want to install Firefox and use Sync on more than one device.{{/t}}
